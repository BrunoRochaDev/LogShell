LogShell is bash script for logging network sessions established via netcat or SSH, such as reverse shells.

It ensures you always have a track of every command ran on a target to look back later.

## Features

- Records shell sessions with timestamped logging.
- Support for Ncat and SSH.
- Preserves color information of the recorded shell output.
- Handles backspaces in user input for clean output.
- Supports automatic detection and logging of session initiation.
- Seamless chains with other tools such as proxychains and rlwrap.
- Easy setup and usage.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrunoRochaDev/LogShell.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```bash
cd LogShell
```

3. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x logshell
```

4. (Optional) Move the script to a directory within your $PATH for easier access:
```bash
mv ./logshell /usr/bin
```

5. Run the script with your SSH / netcat command:
```bash
# Initiating SSH session logging
logshell ssh user@127.0.0.1

# Recording a reverse shell with Ncat and rlwrap
logshell rlwrap ncat -lnvp 1337
```

6. View the logs in /tmp/\<target\>.log (log location can be customized within the script):
```

‚îî‚îÄ$ cat /tmp/127.0.0.1.log

## Future Work

- **Expand Compatibility:** Support additional clients and listeners like `socat` and `nc`.

- **Improve Command/Output Differentiation:** Enhance clarity between user input and listener output for better log readability.

- **Enhance TTY Formatting:** Implement better formatting to handle full TTY without artifacts.
